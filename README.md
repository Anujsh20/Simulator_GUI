The tool is strictly for BCP benches(With some modifications), first things first what exactly the tool can do:

It can read the multimeter current in realtime for testers to verify during their testing:

It can also generate a customised pulse (of defined length). Which one can use to validate invalid and valid wakeup scenarios.
